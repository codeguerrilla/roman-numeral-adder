# roman-numeral-adder

During the "coding dojos" at [Strange Loop 2015][strangeloop], we were presented with a task: Create an application which adds two 
Roman numerals, without converting to a decimal at any time. I thought this was interesting, and decided to complete
the task in my spare time later that day. This is my interpretation using Javascript.

Use 'npm install' to bring in the testing dependencies, and 'npm test' to run the tests.
